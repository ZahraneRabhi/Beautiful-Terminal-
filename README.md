# Desc: 
- Developed this Terminal Customisation lib cuz i didn't bother to understand python GUI libs + Terminal output looks cooler
- Will add more functionalities soon...

# ToDo:
- Make the loading bar pourcentage dynamic
- Add constraints to prevent certain argument values( example: bar_length = 0)
- Try making the loading_bar speed depending on - certain conditions instead of just randomizing the speed_rate
- Khw so far until further Ideas
